encdec is a service for encrypting and decrypting data.  It accepts
requests from stdin and sends responses to stdout.  Requests and responses
are in udpmsg4 format.  The code is simple and clear so you can read the
source if you care in the exact protocol.  php-nacl.php uses the encdec
service if php-nacl is not installed.
