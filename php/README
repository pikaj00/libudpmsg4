This is the PHP implementation.  It can run with UFO's php-nacl module for
PHP or with php-nacl.php and encdec from the C directory.  php-nacl.php is
about 20%-30% slower as UFO's php-nacl for small scripts and about the
same speed for big scripts.  php-nacl.php implements a interface that is
compatible to php-nacl and not requires libudpmsg4.php, you can use it
in other PHP projects that need nacl.  php-nacl.php+encdec not requires
patches for nacl so it is a better choice for some platforms as amd64.
